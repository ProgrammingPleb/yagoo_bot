# Bot Discontinuation
Due to a revamp of the YouTube's site, there will need to be major change made to the bot. Unfortunately due to some issues, I will not be able to maintain the bot. Anyone who wants to continue this bot can fork this repo and continue from here. The original bot, Yagoo#7084, will stop being on operation effective 20th November 2022. If development does resume for the bot, then the original bot will be online once that happens.
